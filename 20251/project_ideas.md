Here are four capstone project ideas tailored for a BI/DA student, ranging in complexity.

---

### 1. The "Natural Language to SQL" Query Generator 🗣️➡️📊

**The Concept:** Build a tool where a business manager can ask a question in plain English, and the application generates the corresponding SQL query to pull that data from a database. This bridges the gap between non-technical users and complex databases.

* **User Input:** "What were our top 5 best-selling products in Europe last quarter?"
* **AI Output:** `SELECT product_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales FROM sales_data WHERE region = 'Europe' AND sale_date >= '2025-07-01' AND sale_date <= '2025-09-30' GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 5;`

**Why It's a Great Fit:** This project is at the heart of BI—democratizing data access. It requires understanding database schemas, SQL logic, and how business questions translate into data queries. It’s a highly practical tool that companies are actively building.

**Key GenAI Skills:**
* **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting precise prompts that give the LLM the database schema and the user's question as context.
* **LLM Integration:** Using a powerful code-generation model (like Gemini or GPT-4).
* **Frameworks (Optional):** Using LangChain's SQL Agent modules to streamline the process.

### 2. Automated Business Insights & Report Generator 📈✍️

**The Concept:** Create an application that ingests a raw dataset (e.g., a CSV file of monthly sales data) and automatically generates a comprehensive business intelligence report. This goes beyond just creating charts; it interprets them.

**The process would be:**
1.  User uploads a dataset.
2.  The application uses a library like Pandas to perform initial data analysis (e.g., find top performers, calculate growth rates, identify trends).
3.  The statistical findings are fed to an LLM.
4.  The LLM generates a full text report including:
    * An **Executive Summary**.
    * **Key Insights** written in clear business language.
    * **Potential Recommendations** based on the data.
    * **Python code** to generate relevant charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).

**Why It's a Great Fit:** This project mimics the entire BI workflow, from data analysis to final reporting. It focuses on the crucial skill of turning raw numbers into a compelling business narrative.

**Key GenAI Skills:**
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Guiding the LLM through a logical sequence of analysis to generate the report.
* **Code Generation:** Prompting the LLM to write correct Python code for visualizations (`Matplotlib` or `Seaborn`).
* **Summarization & Text Generation:** Creating concise summaries and detailed insights.

### 3. Interactive Dashboard Co-Pilot 🤖💬

**The Concept:** Build an AI chatbot that acts as a "co-pilot" for an existing data dashboard (e.g., from Power BI or Tableau). The user can ask questions about the visualizations they are seeing, and the AI will provide explanations and deeper insights.

* **User sees a chart:** A line graph showing a sudden sales drop in March.
* **User asks the Co-pilot:** "Why did sales dip in March?"
* **AI uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The AI has been given the underlying data and metadata for the dashboard. It finds the relevant data for March and analyzes it.
* **AI Responds:** "The sales dip in March correlates with a 50% reduction in our marketing spend for the 'Spring Campaign' that month. Additionally, our top competitor launched a discount offer on March 5th."

**Why It's a Great Fit:** This project focuses on the "intelligence" part of BI. It's not just about showing data but about **interpreting** it in context. It's a very modern application that showcases how AI can augment human analysts.

**Key GenAI Skills:**
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The core of the project. You'll need to use a vector database to store information about the dashboard's data.
* **Building AI Agents:** Creating a system that can understand a user's question and use tools (like a data analysis function) to find the answer.
* **Multi-modal (Advanced):** For a more advanced version, use a model like Gemini Pro Vision to allow the AI to "see" a screenshot of the chart and comment on it directly.

### 4. Synthetic Data Generator for Analytics Testing 🎭💾

**The Concept:** Create a tool that can generate realistic but fake (synthetic) data that mirrors the statistical properties of a real dataset. Business analysts often can't use real customer data for testing or development due to privacy regulations (like GDPR).

* **User Input:** A real (and sensitive) dataset of customer transactions.
* **AI learns:** The AI model (like a GAN or a fine-tuned LLM) learns the patterns, distributions, and relationships between columns in the real data.
* **AI Output:** A new CSV file with any number of rows of artificial data that looks and feels just like the original but contains no real customer information.

**Why It's a Great Fit:** This project tackles a serious, real-world challenge in data analytics: data privacy and availability. It demonstrates a deep understanding of data structure, statistical distributions, and advanced modeling techniques.

**Key GenAI Skills:**
* **Understanding Generative Models:** This could use more specialized models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed for tabular data (e.g., `CTGAN`).
* **Data Analysis & Validation:** The student would need to prove that their synthetic data is a good proxy for the real data by comparing statistical properties (mean, standard deviation, correlations, etc.).
