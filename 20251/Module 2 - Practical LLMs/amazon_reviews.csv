1,Toasts great but difficult to remove English muffins,"I love the way this toaster evenly toasts bread, bagels and english muffins but wish it would raise higher in order to remove the english muffins."
0,What is this book's appeal?,"I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again, and every other page is black and white. No appeal whatsoever to my daughter, now age 18 months, who has had this book since birth. People say it's the 'lulling"" repeatability of the goodnight theme... I say, it's boring. There are so many bright, lively, board books out there today. I do not recommend this one, classic or not."
1,the best mouse I ever had so far,"very good mouse and not just for gaming.I have 1920x1080 screen res. so precision of that mouse is really matter.If you use less then 1024x768 res you might not see any difference, but if you have more then you will see that difference right a way."
0,This moview was horrible. Buy Cops and Robbersons instead.,"This movie was trash. The writing was a joke, the acting was pathetic, and the cinematography was amateur.Cops and Robbersons is a much more complete film and arguably the best movie in American history. Don't waste your time on Citizen Lame. Rent Cops and Robbersons and see what true cinematography is about."
1,"good film, bad dvd",This is a very good van damme action film. Too bad its only out in a full frame version now. Maybe the widescreen version will appear again in the future.
0,"Useful, for hard to read and understand","This book was part of our mandatory purchases for the school year. While I can see why it would be very useful to some, it is very hard to read and understand, even for an Honors English students such as myself. I find myself getting frustrated when reading the word of the book, many because it shows very advanced, college level work that I always think I must copy (the style). While this book was meant to help my classmates and I with research papers, it only makes it more confusing and harder to learn Modern Language Association style."
1,A Surreal Trip,"One of the most faithful adaptations of a literary work ever put on the big screen. Terry Gilliam, of Monty Python fame, directs Johnny Depp in his most exciting role, as the Gonzo journalist, Dr. Hunter S Thompson. The critics hated it when it came out in the theaters. They passed it of as ""nonsense"" and ""totally lacking any cohesion."" But we know better, don't we? If you're the type of person who digs a little deeper than most, and enjoys watching movies that aren't aimed at the masses, then this is for you. Ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Buy this now, movies like this don't come around too often."
0,Total Waste of Money & Time,"This collar did nothing to stop my dog from barking. I even tried changing batteries and it still did not work. My dog ignored it. I eventually bought a PetSafe PDBC-300 with the push button adjustments, which was similar to the old dial type that wore out that I was replacing and it is working fine."
1,THE FORSAKEN,"THE FORSAKEN is a horror/action thriller about a guy named Sean who is driving cross-country to attend his sister's wedding, and along the way he picks up a man named Nick who just happens to be a vampire hunter. Now, Sean is caught up in a battle with a gang of bloodthirsty vampires (The Forsaken), and things take a turn for the worst when Sean becomes infected with the vampire virus, and now he has to battle the undead in order to stay human. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, it has alot of plot twists, and good character development for the human and the vampire characters. This is definitly one of the best vampire movies to come out in the new millenium."
0,Disappointing,"Though the DVD has some really nice extras (interviews, etc.), the restoration leaves a lot to be desired. Much clarity is lost from the original. Almost blurry, like multiple images that don't properly align (the actors all have ""zombie eyes""). Not really watchable. Now shopping for the unrestored version."
0,The day trip-hop died...,"People ordering this should know that Skye, the singer of the past Morcheeba albums, is not on this record. The two men who started the band got a new singer, who just isn't as special, and now the band sounds like a lot of other bands (unfortunately). With Skye gone they just don't stand out from the rest. :-("
1,tryst review,This is a very good book and i really enjoyed it. I was very happy to find it in hardback. thank you
0,Pure garbage,"This book reflects a message about what I'm thinking is the author's own religious bias. It's garbage. No where does it even mention population control, overpopulation causing climate problems, the need for birth control, poverty amongst peoples with no birth control. It's wordy."
0,Inexpensive and cheaply made,I would not recommend this item. The weave is very loose and does not offer much support. I plan to send mine back for a refund.
1,A Blast from my Past,"I was sure I was the only person who still remembered this series, but I'm pleased to see I was wrong. The stories while sometimes a bit simplistic as much of television was then, still offer an interesting mixture of comedy, drama, and romance with a good dose of history thrown in. The only thing that could have made it better was if they had included commentaries from some of the actors, or perhaps some of Seattle's real history to compare the series to. Overall though, I have throughly enjoyed watching the entire set. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the series when it originally aired, especially those who used to have Bobby Sherman's pictures all over their walls like I did."
1,Large size sandals,"They are sturdy, fashionable, and run true-to-size. The price was very reasonable, and I'm very pleased with my purchase"
1,Hoot is a Hoot,OK First of all this is supposed to be a book for kids.I have read about everything Hiaasen has written. I am a 50+ adult and loved this book. Any one who likes Hiassens work will find this fun and a little less bizarre then his adult work. I almost never give a rating of 5 stars but this deserved it.
1,as advertised,Shows reliable holding power. Withstood 11 ton vessel in 35 knot winds. Dries up rapidly when soaked. Allows minimal stretch. Recommend shafing protection around pilings.
1,Epson minus Canon=New Top Of Line Scanner,"With the discontinuation of Canon's popular and highly rated Canoscan 9950 F, the Epson 4990 is by default the new flatbed color scanner champ. I don't think I'm just going to wait while Canon gets around to coughing up a new and persumably better successor to the 9950 F. What arrogance! I'm switching to Epson today.Canon=STUPID."
